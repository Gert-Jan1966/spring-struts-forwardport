## spring-struts-forwardport
A Spring 4.1.5 compatible spring-struts package

### Why a Spring 4.1.5 compatible spring-struts package?
I was required to use Struts 1.2.4 but I wanted to be able to utilize the latest version of Spring (4.1.5 at this moment).

### This code originates from the Spring 3.2.13 spring-struts package
The pom file has been reworked to reflect the Spring 4.1.5 dependencies.
I didn't need Tiles support, so all Tiles related classes and unittest have been discarded.
